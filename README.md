## Overview

_**Retro ** Dance like nobody's watching. Like it's 1986. @home_

### Core Features

- _Full-stack, full-CRUD app, utilizing a RESTful JSON API with the so-called "React on Rails" stack_

### Goals

- Have a **RESTful JSON API**.
- Build a **Ruby on Rails** server, exposing RESTful JSON endpoints.
- Build a database with at least 3 tables:

  - 1 user table
  - 2 other tables, of your choosing
  - There must be at least 2 pairs of associated tables. (1:m _or_ m:m)
  - Utilize **Rails** to define models for interacting with the database.
  - Implement Authentication using **JWT**.
  - Implement working generic controller actions for full-CRUD (`index`, `show`, `create`, `update`, `delete`) between the 2 non-user tables AND partial-CRUD (`create`, at least) for the user table.

- Have a working, interactive **React** app, built using `npx create-react-app`.
  - Have at least 8 separate, rendered components in an organized and understandable React file structure.
  - Utilize functional and class React components appropriately.
  - Utilize state and props in your components efficiently.
  - Use _only_ React for DOM Manipulation.
- Consume data from your **Ruby on Rails API**, and render that data in your components.
- Utilize **React Router**, for client-side routing.
- Utilize Authentication, permitting the user to:
  - Register, login, and send authenticated requests.
  - Perform `index` or `show` actions, **whether or not they are logged in**.^
  - Perform `create`, `update`, and `delete` actions **when logged in**.

#### Component Hierarchy

> Use this section to define your React components and the data architecture of your app.

```structure

src
|__ assets/
      |__ fonts
      |__ graphics
      |__ images
      |__ mockups
|__ components/
      |__ Header.jsx
|__ services/

```

#### Component Breakdown

> Use this section to go into further depth regarding your components, including breaking down the components as stateless or stateful, and considering the passing of data between those components.

|  Component   |    Type    | state | props | Description                                                      |
| :----------: | :--------: | :---: | :---: | :--------------------------------------------------------------- |
|    Header    | functional |   n   |   n   | _The header will contain the navigation and logo._               |
|  Navigation  | functional |   n   |   n   | _The navigation will provide a link to each of the pages._       |
|   Gallery    |   class    |   y   |   n   | _The gallery will render the posts using cards in flexbox._      |
| Gallery Card | functional |   n   |   y   | _The cards will render the post info via props._                 |
|    Footer    | functional |   n   |   n   | _The footer will show info about me and a link to my portfolio._ |

#### Component Estimates

> Use this section to estimate the time necessary to build out each of the components you've described above.

| Task                | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| ------------------- | :------: | :------------: | :-----------: | :---------: |
| Add Contact Form    |    L     |     3 hrs      |     2 hrs     |    3 hrs    |
| Create CRUD Actions |    H     |     3 hrs      |     1 hrs     |     TBD     |
| TOTAL               |          |     6 hrs      |     3 hrs     |     TBD     |

> _Why is this necessary? Time frames are key to the development cycle. You have limited time to code your app, and your estimates can then be used to evalute possibilities of your MVP and post-MVP based on time needed. It's best you assume an additional hour for each component, as well as a few hours added to the total time, to play it safe._
